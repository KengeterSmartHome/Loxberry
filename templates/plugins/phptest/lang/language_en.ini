TITLE=LoxBerry welcomes PHP!
INTRO=The LoxBerry PHP modules does support your plugin development not only by global path variables and printing headers and footers. It also has multilingual support <b>out-of-the-box</b>.
USAGE1=Using the template directory layout recommended for LoxBerry, the template system automatically detects users language, searches for the appropriate language file and gives you an array with the correct phrases.
USAGE2=It also has an automatic fallback system to English - that means: If a phrase is not found in the user language, it will print it in English. Therefore, the LoxBerry team recommends to start your translation with the English translation file.
HELP=For the help on the right side (try it!), you also can use a separate multilingual template with language files, or you can create complete HTML files for every language. It is your decision.
FINALMESSAGE=I hope you like our efforts to make you happy!
