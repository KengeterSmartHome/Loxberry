INTRO_HEADER="About Miniserver"
INTRO_TEXT1="LoxBerry allows to add one or more Miniservers. Plugins will use this information to communicate with your Miniservers."
BUTTONS="<b>Add Miniserver</b> will add another block for a new Miniserver, <b>Delete Miniserver</b> will delete <i>the last</i> Miniserver in the list. <b>Search for Miniserver</b> will add the first Miniserver found into the first Miniserver entry. You still have to configure the credentials."
MINISERVER="After you have configured the credentials, you should <b>Check Miniserver authentication</b>. Some plugins requires an Administrator user to work properly. For every Miniserver, you can open it's webinterface (<b>Loxone Web App</b>), and also the <b>Miniserver Logfile</b>."
CLOUDDNS="<b>Use Loxone Cloud DNS</b> should <i>only</i> be used, when the Miniserver is not in your local network. Configure the <b>MAC address</b> of your Miniserver, and LoxBerry will query it's current ip from Loxone on demand. We recommend to not open your Miniserver to the internet, but instead use a VPN."
