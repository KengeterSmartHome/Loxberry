SETTINGS_FRIENDLYNAME="<b>Give your LoxBerry a Name:</b> This name is shown in the window title and in the header, to faster identify the specific LoxBerry (if you have multiple LoxBerrys in your home). It is not used as hostname, therefore you can use whatever you like."
SETTINGS_SENDDATA="LoxBerry generates an anonymous key, that is securely sent to loxberry.de to count all installed LoxBerrys, installed plugins and it's version numbers. It is not possible to get back from the key to you or your LoxBerry. There is no 'open gate' to your LoxBerry. Disabling the checkbox turns off these statistic data."
